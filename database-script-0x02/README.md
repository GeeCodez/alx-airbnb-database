# Sample Data for Hotel Booking System

This database contains sample data for a hotel booking system.

- It includes tables for **users**, **properties**, **bookings**, **payments**, **reviews**, and **messages**.  
- Users have roles as **guests** or **hosts**.  
- Properties are linked to hosts and include details like **location**, **price per night**, and **description**.  
- Bookings connect guests to properties with **start and end dates**, **total price**, and **status**.  
- Payments are recorded for confirmed bookings with different **payment methods**.  
- Reviews allow guests to rate properties and leave comments (**ratings between 2 and 5**).  
- Messages simulate communication between guests and hosts.  
- All IDs are **UUIDs** generated automatically for uniqueness.  
- This data can be used to **test, develop, or showcase** the hotel booking system features.  
- The sample data is randomized to provide realistic scenarios for testing.
